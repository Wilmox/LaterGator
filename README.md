## Configuration  
Later Gator allowing you to configure various settings to your preferences. You can edit the configuration options at the bottom of the `latergator.js` file. Some of the available options include:

* `batchSize`: How many videos to remove in one iteration, YouTube API has a limit on 200, so going above is useless
* `waitBetweenBatches`: How long to wait between batches in milliseconds (5 min. recommended) 
  * To calculate the number of minutes multiply your number in minutes by 1000 and by 60 (e.g. `1000 * 60 * 5` for 5 minutes)
* `waitBetweenDeletions`: Milliseconds between each deletion
* `playlistSize`: How many videos in the playlist
